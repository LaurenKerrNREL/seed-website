# Getting Started

The following information will help you get started using the SEED Platform once you have an account, either a third party hosted instance, or your own instance, or a test account on the LBNL hosted SEED instance.

## Getting Started Guides

## Sample Data

Download the [SEED Sample Data zip](http://seedinfo.lbl.gov/getting-started/seed-sample-data.zip?attredirects=0&d=1), which contains two sample data files:

- **covered-buildings-sample.csv**&mdash;sample tax assessor data with 512 building records
- **portfolio-manager-sample.csv**&mdash;sample Energy Star Portfolio Manager data with 512 records which match the data in covered-buildings-sample.csv based on the Address field

This is clearly the "ideal" case, but it is a good set of test data to make sure that the program is performing properly.
