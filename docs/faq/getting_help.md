# FAQ - Getting Help

## What resources or support do you provide to jurisdictions interested in using SEED as part of a benchmarking program?

We typically provide technical support within reason as needed. As the community grows, there are more users able to provide support. It is recommended to use [GitHub issues](https://github.com/SEED-platform/seed/issues) to a) view existing feature requests and issues, and b) communicate with various developers.
