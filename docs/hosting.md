# Hosting

SEED Platform is a web-based database tool, and therefore must be "hosted" on a web server. It is not designed to be installed on an end-user's desktop computer. There are several options for how SEED can be "hosted"

## Third-party hosting

SEED can be hosted by third party hosting providers who will provide access to a SEED account. Providers will be LBNL-approved and will be responsible with keeping up with the updates to the code. See the Technical Allies page for current hosting providers.

## Self hosted

Many organizations that are interested in using SEED may want to host their own installation of SEED. This requires the SEED source code, installation scripts, and installation instructions, all available in GitHub. Note that SEED is a server-based web application that is not designed to be installed on an end-user's desktop computer. Self-hosting of SEED requires some experience with server and database administration, and will usually require the involvement of an organization's IT department for installation and operation of an instance of SEED Platform.

## Temporary test account through LBNL

We are currently open to generating temporary test accounts for state and local governments, and/or their relevant service providers that are exploring or in the process of implementing a building energy benchmarking ordinance. For more information, visit the [LBNL SEED Platform](lbnl.md) page.
